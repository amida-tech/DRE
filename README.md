High Level Overview
===================
![DRE High Level Diagram](docs/images/dre_overview_new.png)

The purpose of the Data Reconciliation Engine is to take personal health data in a variety of formats (starting with BlueButton/CCDA) from multiple sources and parse/normalize/de-duplicate/merge it into a single Patient's Master Health Record with patient assistance (although most of hard work will be done automagically).


DRE's components
=================
![DRE Components Diagram](docs/images/dre_four_components.png)

DRE has 4 primary elements

#### 1 - Parsing and Normalization Library.

This parses incoming data into a homogenous, simplified and normalized data model in JSON format.

Parsing library code: [amida-tech/blue-button](https://github.com/amida-tech/blue-button)


#### 2 - Matching Library.

This takes the standardized data elements and flags probable duplicate values. New patient records are compared against the existing Master Health Record and automatically matched. The result produces a list of all entries in the new record, labelled as duplicates (0 % match), new entries (100% match), or partial matches (to be reconciled by patient in a next step).

Matching library code: [amida-tech/blue-button-match](https://github.com/amida-tech/blue-button-match)

#### 3 - Reconciliation Interface.

This provides a RESTful API and UI for review and evaluation of duplicate or partially matched entries, by the patient.

#### 4 - Master Record Interface.

This provides a API for interaction with and access to the aggregated health record.
